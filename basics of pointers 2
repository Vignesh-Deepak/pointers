#include <stdio.h>
int main(void){
    int arr[5]={1,7};// remaining are assumed as zero or garbage value // hint 2 eventhough it has more elements , the pointer considered only default array index[0] first. until the iteration is used for all
    int *p; 
    p=arr; // here in arrays & strings we can use with or without (&) symbol 
    int (*ptr)[5]; // (*ptr)[5] 5 pointer pointing to 5 element address   (5 pointer for diff)  ;  (5 pointer for each value address) pointers to array concept
                   // *ptr [5] is a error (one pointer for each memory location(address) possible only through iteration  
    ptr =arr;
    printf("p=%d, ptr=%d\n",*p++,*p); // o/p = 1, 2     
    printf("p=%d, ptr=%d\n",++*p,*p); //  o/p =2,2
    printf("p=%p, ptr=%p\n",*p++,*p); // o/p will be in hexadecimal 16 0-9(9) 10-A, 11-B 15- f , 16-10 to 25- 19 (9 ) 26 -1A
    *p++; // add int type to hexadecimal value only for zeroth element of array  (default int datatype byte=2) if 2 int numbers are bytes are added 2,2 means total 4 bytes
    *ptr++; // add int type X no of variables eg 5 means 2 X5 = 10 bytes  (while comes for hexadecimal it counts for 32 bit compiler there int =4 bytes, char =2, float=8)
    
    
}

eg                   arr[0]  arr[1] arr[2]  arr[3]  arr[4]
ptr                    5       7      2      9       8
80024               80024    80028  80032   80036  80040  
 
ptr[0]= 80024  ,  *ptr[0]=5

1. ptr does not contain any memory address ,it takes memory location  of zeroth element(that its address) as its address
2. here 8002x is a example we cannot see what memory address is used , it can be any order 
3. in general -> one pointer  points to different memory location when incremented (similar to value incremented)
4.
